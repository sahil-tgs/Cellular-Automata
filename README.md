# Cellular Automata Simulator

## Introduction
This project is a simple cellular automata simulator implemented in C++. Cellular automata are discrete models studied in computer science, mathematics, and physics to simulate complex systems.

For more information on cellular automata, check out the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Make utility

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahil-tgs/Cellular-Automata.git
   cd Cellular-Automata
   
2. Build the project using the provided Makefile:
   ```bash
   make

3. Run the simulator:
   ```bash
   ./game_of_life

## Usage
Upon running the simulator, you can see some patter on the terminal which u can exit from by pressing `ctrl + X` .

## Additional Resources
For more details and advanced usage, refer to the project wiki. (comming soon)
